Activity 1:
page 1 - "You are about to a shortened versionâ€¦ "

Activity 4? PERSONAL INTERESTS:
The Like Unsure and Dislike buttons COMPLETELY DISREGARD THE STYLE OF THE SITE.  Please remove these. Radio buttons or simple colored boxes are much more appropriate.

There are quotes on the page 7.

Activity 5: Writeup -

"The factors that made the pathway you chose more appealing than the other pathways in the cluster"
"The type of education are you likely to need if you pursue this pathway"
MISSING VERBS!!

Activity 8:

Activity 9:
